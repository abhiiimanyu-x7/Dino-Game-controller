Creating a hand gesture-controlled version of the Chrome Dinosaur game using OpenCV involves several steps. The idea is to capture hand gestures through the webcam and map these gestures to control the gameâ€™s actions, such as jumping and ducking.
Open the Chrome Dinosaur game (type chrome://dino in your browser's address bar).
Run the script.
Use the detected hand gestures to control the dinosaur:
Raise your index finger above your thumb to jump.
Lower your index finger below your thumb to duck.
